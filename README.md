# Pick Your Boss Battle
## An Overwatch Workshop Mode
### Created by Philip Haynes

A silly game where 6 players must pick 1 person to be the Boss. The Boss picks Perks and Heroes pick Boons, which upgrade each side respectively. Perks and Boons contribute to a Wager, which is a rough way to gauge the difficulty of the match-up. Aim for relatively even wagers for the best competition, or go wild and see how crazy it can get! The choice is yours!

Best played in a voice call with all players (Match chat is enabled).
